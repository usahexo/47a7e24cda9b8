But what if you played with some high-roller poker chips?</p>
<p>Online game developer Endorphina has created special $1 million poker chips to celebrate its 5-year anniversary. The commemorative chips will be available at all live and online casino games that are powered by the Prague-based software company.</p>
<p>This isn’t the first time that Endorphina has produced over-the-top poker chips. In 2016, the company created a $100,000 chip to celebrate its 4-year anniversary.</p>
<p>But why produce such extravagant poker chips? “It is all about giving players an unforgettable experience,” said Vratislav Kolar, CEO of Endorphina. “We constantly work on new and innovative ideas to keep our games fresh and exciting.”</p>
<p>And it seems to be working. The company’s portfolio of games has been downloaded more than 150 million times by players in over 190 countries.</p>
<p>The $1 million chips won’t be available for purchase, but they will be given out as rewards to lucky players. So start spinning those reels and hoping for a big win!</p>
<h1 id="Huge-Jackpot-Awaits-Players-of-Poker-Online-Games"><a href="#Huge-Jackpot-Awaits-Players-of-Poker-Online-Games" class="headerlink" title="Huge Jackpot Awaits Players of Poker Online Games!"></a>Huge Jackpot Awaits Players of Poker Online Games!</h1><p>There is just one word to describe the current state of online poker – huge! The biggest names in the industry are now battling for supremacy, and the rewards are unprecedented. So far in 2017, the world’s two biggest poker tournaments have seen prize pools worth over $100 million.</p>
<p>The first of these tournaments was the World Series of Poker (WSOP) Main Event, which had a total prize pool of $62,874,392. The winner of this event, Pennsylvania-based Scott Blumstein, took home a whopping $8,148,002.</p>
<p>This was then surpassed by the World Poker Tour (WPT) Doyle Brunson Five Diamond World Poker Classic, which had a total prize pool of $110,668,000. The eventual champion of this event was 56-year-old Jonathan Little from Florida, who walked away with a massive $1,927,090 in prize money.</p>
<p>What’s particularly impressive about these numbers is that they continue to grow larger each year. The WSOP Main Event has seen its prize pool increase by more than 25% since 2014, while the WPT Doyle Brunson Five Diamond World Poker Classic has seen its prize pool more than double in size over the same period.</p>
<p>This trend is likely to continue in the years ahead as online poker continues to grow in popularity. With ever increasing jackpots on offer, it’s no wonder that players are flocking to the tables in record numbers. If you want to be a part of this exciting and rewarding industry, then now is certainly the time to get started!</p>

<h1 id="Play-Poker-Online-and-You-Could-Win-a-Share-of-Over-10-Million-in-Prizes"><a href="#Play-Poker-Online-and-You-Could-Win-a-Share-of-Over-10-Million-in-Prizes" class="headerlink" title="Play Poker Online and You Could Win a Share of Over $10 Million in Prizes!"></a>Play Poker Online and You Could Win a Share of Over $10 Million in Prizes!</h1><p>If you enjoy playing poker, there is no better place to be than online. Not only will you have access to more games and higher stakes than you would at a brick-and-mortar casino, but you could also win a share of over $10 million in prizes!</p>
<p>The majority of online poker rooms offer Texas hold’em and other variants such as Omaha and Seven-card stud. The buy-ins for these games range from a few dollars to hundreds of dollars, so there is something for everyone. Moreover, the competition is usually much softer than at a land-based casino, making it easier to make money.</p>
<p>In addition to the regular rewards that online poker rooms offer, such as cash bonuses and tournament tickets, some rooms also run special promotions. For example, partypoker is currently running a “Powerfest” tournament series that has a total prize pool of over $10 million. This includes several events with seven-figure prize pools, so there is plenty of money up for grabs!</p>
<p>So if you are looking for some excitement and want a chance to win big bucks, then head on over to an online poker room today and start playing!</p>
