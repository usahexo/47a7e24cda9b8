However, one of the more fun and unique methods is to play fitness bingo. This is a great way to mix up your workout routine, keep things interesting, and have some fun while working up a sweat. </p>
<p>Here is how to play fitness bingo in Ukraine: </p>
<ol>
<li><p>Choose a square area that is at least 10 yards by 10 yards. If you are playing inside, use tape or chalk to mark out the boundaries of the playing area.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Place several objects or markers in the playing area. These can be anything from cones to small weights or balls.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Split players into two teams (or more depending on the number of participants).</p>
</li>
<li><p>Each player selects a marker and stands in one corner of the playing area.</p>
</li>
<li><p>The first player on each team starts by picking up their marker and running to another part of the playing area, so that they are now opposite their teammate who is still holding the marker. </p>
</li>
<li><p>Without dropping their marker, both players must then attempt to complete as many aerobic exercises as possible before one of them gets back to their original spot and tags their teammate who then becomes active. </p>
</li>
<li><p>The game continues until either all players have completed a round or someone drops their marker (in which case they are out for that round).  </p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>The winning team is the one who completes the most rounds in total, or whoever is left standing if time runs out.</p>
