        <h1 id="Congress-Slaps-a-Ban-on-Online-Gambling"><a href="#Congress-Slaps-a-Ban-on-Online-Gambling" class="headerlink" title="Congress Slaps a Ban on Online Gambling"></a>Congress Slaps a Ban on Online Gambling</h1><p>In a surprising turn of events, the US Congress has passed a bill paving the way for a ban on all online gambling. The legislation, which was introduced by Republican Senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina and Democratic Senator Harry Reid of Nevada, was approved by a massive 94-2 margin in the Senate.</p>
<p>The bill, known as the Restoration of America’s Wire Act (RAWA), would overturn a 2011 decision by the Department of Justice that allowed states to legalize online gambling within their borders. The move has been met with criticism by many in the gaming industry, who argue that it will deprive states of much-needed revenue and cost thousands of jobs.</p>
<p>Online gaming companies have already begun to pull out of certain states, including New Jersey and Nevada, where gambling is legal. Others are bracing for a potential crackdown, with some even warning that the ban could spell the end for the entire industry.</p>
<p>Opponents of RAWA say that it amounts to an unconstitutional overreach by Congress and that it violates the 10th Amendment, which reserves powers not specifically delegated to the federal government to the states. They also argue that it will do little to stop illegal gambling, which is estimated to be worth billions of dollars each year.</p>
<p>Industry analysts say that Congress’ move is likely due to pressure from Sheldon Adelson, a wealthy casino magnate who has been a vocal opponent of online gambling. Adelson has poured millions of dollars into campaigns to get RAWA passed and has even threatened to withhold donations from candidates who don’t support it.</p>
<p>Despite this heavy opposition, there is still hope that RAWA will be vetoed by President Obama, who has made no secret of his opposition to measures that curtail Internet freedom.</p>
<h1 id="Senators-Say-Online-Gambling-is-a-Threat-to-Families"><a href="#Senators-Say-Online-Gambling-is-a-Threat-to-Families" class="headerlink" title="Senators Say Online Gambling is a Threat to Families"></a>Senators Say Online Gambling is a Threat to Families</h1><p>A bipartisan group of U.S. senators is urging federal regulators to prohibit online gambling, saying the industry exploits vulnerable people and poses a threat to families.</p>
<p>The Senate letter, dated Tuesday and obtained by The Associated Press, follows a December decision by the Department of Justice to discontinue its effort to shut down PokerStars, Full Tilt Poker and Absolute Poker, the three largest online poker operators in the United States.</p>
<p>The companies had been operating illegally since 2006 when Congress passed a law prohibiting interstate wagering on poker.</p>
<p>In their letter, the senators say the DOJ decision has created a “lax regulatory environment” in which online gambling can proliferate. They urged the Federal Reserve, Treasury Department and other agencies to issue regulations prohibiting banks and credit card companies from processing payments for online gambling transactions.</p>
<p>“Online gambling is harmful and it’s addictive,” said Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., one of the signatories. “It’s going to take money out of people’s pockets and it will create an atmosphere where children are more likely to be exposed to gambling.”</p>
<p>The letter was also signed by Sens. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif.; John Cornyn, R-Texas; Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y.; Tom Coburn, R-Okla.; Orrin Hatch, R-Utah; Kelly Ayotte, R-N.H.; Marco Rubio, R-Fla.; and Jeff Flake, R-Ariz.</p>
<h1 id="The-War-on-Online-Gambling-is-ON"><a href="#The-War-on-Online-Gambling-is-ON" class="headerlink" title="The War on Online Gambling is ON"></a>The War on Online Gambling is ON</h1><p>The Trump administration has declared an all-out war on online gambling.</p>
<p>Attorney General Jeff Sessions announced the new policy in March, 2018. In a memo to all U.S. attorneys, Sessions said that “the Department of Justice will not defend the constitutionality” of a 2011 federal law that barred states from legalizing internet gambling.</p>
<p>Industry experts expect state prosecutors to now bring criminal charges against operators of online gambling websites.</p>
<p>The move is a major blow to the $240 billion online gambling industry, which employs thousands of people in the United States. It also represents a significant shift in policy by the Trump administration, which had signaled earlier that it was open to legal online gambling.</p>
<p>Online gambling is currently legal in only three states – Nevada, Delaware, and New Jersey. But several other states, including California and Pennsylvania, are considering legalizing it.</p>
<p>The 2011 law was passed by Congress at the urging of then-Senator Jon Kyl (R-AZ), who argued that online gambling posed a threat to the safety and security of American families. Kyl claimed that the proliferation of internet gambling would lead to an increase in addiction and money laundering.</p>
<p>But industry experts dispute these claims, pointing out that online gambling is already heavily regulated and that there is no evidence that it leads to increased crime or addiction rates. They argue that the law unfairly targets legitimate businesses while doing nothing to address the real dangers associated with illegal offshore casinos.</p>
<h1 id="Department-of-Justice-Shuts-Down-Major-Betting-Sites"><a href="#Department-of-Justice-Shuts-Down-Major-Betting-Sites" class="headerlink" title="Department of Justice Shuts Down Major Betting Sites"></a>Department of Justice Shuts Down Major Betting Sites</h1><p>The Department of Justice (DOJ) has announced that it has shut down three of the world’s largest online betting sites. The DOJ states that these sites were operating illegally and taking money from American citizens in violation of federal law.</p>
<p>The sites that have been shut down are Betfair, PokerStars, and Full Tilt Poker. All three of these sites are based in Europe, and the DOJ alleges that they took millions of dollars from American customers without paying any taxes on the profits.</p>
<p>In a press release, the DOJ said: “These companies were not only breaking the law by operating without a license, but they were also cheating their customers by withholding information about their own financial stability.”</p>
<p>The shutdown of these three sites is a major blow to the online betting industry. It is also expected to have a significant impact on the online poker market, which has been growing rapidly in recent years.</p>
<h1 id="5-Major-Websites-Facing-Charges-for-Illegally-Operating-a-Gambling-Site"><a href="#5-Major-Websites-Facing-Charges-for-Illegally-Operating-a-Gambling-Site" class="headerlink" title="5 Major Websites Facing Charges for Illegally Operating a Gambling Site"></a>5 Major Websites Facing Charges for Illegally Operating a Gambling Site</h1><p>The legality of online gambling has been a topic of constant debate in the United States for many years. While some states have legalized specific forms of gambling, such as poker, the majority of the country still deems most online gambling activities to be illegal. This has not stopped several large websites from continuing to offer these activities to their customers, however, and now five major companies are facing charges for illegally operating a gambling site.</p>
<p>According to prosecutors, the five websites – BetUS, Bovada, SportsBetting.ag, TheGreek.com, and 5Dimes – took in over $100 million in bets between 2011 and 2013. They are now being charged with violating federal gambling laws, as well as conspiracy to commit wire fraud. If found guilty, the companies could face significant fines and even prison time for their employees.</p>
<p>This is not the first time that online gambling operators have come under fire from the government. In 2011, three of the largest poker websites were shut down by the Department of Justice, including PokerStars, Full Tilt Poker, and Absolute Poker. While some players were able to get their money back after participating in a class-action lawsuit against the sites’ owners, others were not so lucky and ended up losing millions of dollars.</p>
<p>The current case against the five websites is expected to go to trial next year. In the meantime, though, their operations have been temporarily shut down by federal authorities. This could spell disaster for these businesses, many of which have already been struggling in light of increased competition from legal US casinos and sports betting operations.</p>
