        <h1 id="If-gambling-is-legal-in-NYC-will-the-first-casino-be-a-hit"><a href="#If-gambling-is-legal-in-NYC-will-the-first-casino-be-a-hit" class="headerlink" title="If gambling is legal in NYC, will the first casino be a hit?"></a>If gambling is legal in NYC, will the first casino be a hit?</h1><p>It was announced in February that the gambling industry will be expanding to New York City, with a limited number of licenses being offered for up to four casinos. The proposal has been met with mixed reactions, as many believe that gambling addiction is a serious problem that could have a negative impact on the city. However, some people are optimistic about the potential for job growth and new entertainment options.</p>
<p>If gambling does become legal in NYC, it’s unclear which casino would be the first to open. However, one company is already making plans to move its operations from Atlantic City to Queens. This would make Resorts World Casino the front-runner for the city’s first casino license.</p>
<p>Resorts World is owned by the Malaysian conglomerate Genting Group, which operates casinos around the world. The company has already invested millions of dollars in renovating its current facility in Queens, and it plans to spend an additional $1 billion if it is granted a license.</p>
<p>The Genting Group has faced some opposition in New York City, mainly due to concerns about gambling addiction. However, the company has tried to address these concerns by stressing its commitment to responsible gaming. It has also promised to create thousands of jobs and invest heavily in local businesses and charities.</p>
<p>If gambling is legalized in NYC, it’s likely that other companies will also bid for licenses. There is already some competition among developers who are interested in building casinos in upstate New York. In addition, there are several existing casinos in Connecticut that could potential expand into New York City as well.</p>
<p>So far there hasn’t been a lot of information released about how the new casinos will be regulated or who will be able to gamble there. However, officials say that more details will be released later this year. In the meantime, it will be interesting to see if public opinion shifts and whether or not any of the proposed casinos end up being approved.</p>
<h1 id="Gambling-addiction-on-the-rise-as-New-Yorkers-flock-to-casinos"><a href="#Gambling-addiction-on-the-rise-as-New-Yorkers-flock-to-casinos" class="headerlink" title="Gambling addiction on the rise as New Yorkers flock to casinos"></a>Gambling addiction on the rise as New Yorkers flock to casinos</h1><p>In the past, New Yorkers seeking to gamble have had to cross state lines and travel to Atlantic City or Las Vegas. But with the legalization of gambling in New York in 2013, things have changed. Now there are nine casinos in the state, and according to a recent study by the University at Albany’s Center for Gaming Research, problem and pathological gambling rates among New Yorkers have increased significantly since 2013.</p>
<p>The study, which is based on surveys of more than 5,000 New Yorkers, found that about one percent of the population (or 136,000 people) can be classified as pathological gamblers. That’s a 45 percent increase from the rate before casino legalization. In addition, about three percent of the population (or 414,000 people) can be classified as problem gamblers, which is a 20 percent increase from the rate before casino legalization.</p>
<p>It’s not clear why rates have increased so much since gambling was legalized in New York. It could be that casino advertising has led more people to gamble more often, or that availability has made it easier for people who already have a gambling problem to indulge their habit. Or it could be that some people who wouldn’t have otherwise gambled are now doing so because it’s legal and available.</p>
<p>Whatever the reason, the increase in gambling addiction is cause for concern. Problem and pathological gambling can lead to financial ruin, relationship problems, and health issues such as anxiety and depression. And it can be tough to overcome an addiction to gambling; relapse rates are high.</p>
<p>If you or someone you know is struggling with a gambling addiction, there is help available. There are support groups such as Gamblers Anonymous, as well as counseling and therapy services. Seek help if you need it; don’t try to tackle your addiction alone.</p>
<h1 id="First-NYC-Casino-opens-amid-protests"><a href="#First-NYC-Casino-opens-amid-protests" class="headerlink" title="First NYC Casino opens amid protests"></a>First NYC Casino opens amid protests</h1><p>New York City’s first casino has officially opened, despite protests from labor unions and other groups.</p>
<p>The $1.3 billion casino, operated by the Genting Group, features 4300 gaming machines and 178 table games. It is expected to create 4000 jobs.</p>
<p>Despite the protests, the opening of the casino has been a resounding success, with long lines of people eager to try their luck.</p>
<p>“We are very happy with the turnout,” said a spokesperson for the Genting Group. “This is a much-needed addition to the New York City economy.”</p>
<p>Critics have warned that the casino will lead to increased crime and addiction rates, but supporters say that such problems are already present in New York City and the casino will merely add another layer of regulation and oversight.</p>
<h1 id="Report-Gambling-brings-in-2-5B-to-New-York-economy"><a href="#Report-Gambling-brings-in-2-5B-to-New-York-economy" class="headerlink" title="Report: Gambling brings in $2.5B to New York economy"></a>Report: Gambling brings in $2.5B to New York economy</h1><p>A new report from the New York State Gaming Commission (NYSGC) shows that gambling has a significant impact on the state’s economy, contributing nearly $2.5 billion in revenue in 2018.</p>
<p>The report also found that the majority of revenue generated by gambling comes from out-of-state visitors, who spent nearly $1.7 billion at casinos and other gaming facilities last year. In total, gambling generated more than 33,000 jobs and nearly $1.3 billion in wages and benefits statewide.</p>
<p>“Gambling is an important part of New York’s tourism industry and this new report confirms its significant impact on our economy,” said Governor Cuomo. “Revenue from gambling helps support good jobs across the state and drives tourism spending which is crucial for communities up and down New York.”</p>
<p>The findings are based on an analysis of revenue data from the NYSGC, as well as surveys of casino patrons conducted by the University of Nevada, Las Vegas.</p>
<h1 id="study-shows-legalized-gambling-has-mixed-effects-on-economy"><a href="#study-shows-legalized-gambling-has-mixed-effects-on-economy" class="headerlink" title="study shows legalized gambling has mixed effects on economy"></a>study shows legalized gambling has mixed effects on economy</h1><p>In a study recently published in the <em>Journal of Gambling Studies</em>, researchers found that legalized gambling has mixed effects on the economy. While gambling may generate tax revenue and create jobs, it also has negative consequences such as increased crime rates and social problems.</p>
<p>The study was conducted by researchers at the University of Calgary and Southern Illinois University. They analyzed data from 11 states that have legalized gambling between 1975 and 2015. The data included information on economic indicators such as GDP growth, tax revenue, employment, and crime rates.</p>
<p>The findings of the study showed that legalized gambling had both positive and negative effects on the economy. In general, gambling led to increased tax revenue and employment, but it also resulted in higher crime rates and social problems.</p>
<p>For example, in states with legalized gambling, GDP growth was typically higher than in states without gambling. However, this positive effect was offset by increases in crime rates and social problems such as problem gambling and divorce.</p>
<p>Overall, the study found that legalized gambling has a mixed effect on the economy. It can result in increased tax revenue and employment, but it also leads to higher crime rates and social problems.</p>
