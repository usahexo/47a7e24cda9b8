The move by the company’s parent, Red Rock Resorts Inc., is part of a larger plan to reduce its $4.8 billion debt pile.</p>
<p>Under the proposed terms of the deal, Blackstone would acquire around 72% of the outstanding shares in the real-estate investment trust (REIT) that owns Red Rock Resort, Green Valley Ranch and Palace Station Hotel &amp; Casino for around $328 million.</p>
<p>Red Rock Resorts would then redeem all of the REIT’s remaining shares for about $472 million, including $75 million in cash and assumption of debt. This would leave Blackstone as the sole owner of the resorts.</p>
<p>The move will see Red Rock Resorts reduce its debt by around $454 million and come as a blow to casino workers who were hoping for an ownership stake in the company. It is not yet clear what impact this will have on staff at the three casinos involved.</p>
<p>“This transaction provides an immediate and significant deleveraging event for Red Rock and our shareholders,” said CEO Marc Falcone. “We believe this monetization provides additional liquidity that will help position Red Rock to capture future growth opportunities.” </p>
<p>The sale still requires regulatory approval, but is expected to close by the end of 2019.</p>
<h1 id="Station-Casino’s-Parent-Company-Has-a-Long-History-of-Legal-Issues"><a href="#Station-Casino’s-Parent-Company-Has-a-Long-History-of-Legal-Issues" class="headerlink" title="Station Casino’s Parent Company Has a Long History of Legal Issues"></a>Station Casino’s Parent Company Has a Long History of Legal Issues</h1><p>In the early 1990s, Station Casinos was a small startup in Las Vegas. In those days, it was all about the locals. The company’s marketing strategy was to offer lower prices and better comps than the larger casinos on the Strip. </p>
<p>The company soon became one of the most successful casino operators in Nevada, and by the late 1990s, it had expanded to other parts of the country. Station Casinos went public in 1998.</p>
<p>However, as the company grew larger, its legal problems began to mount. In 2003, the Nevada Gaming Commission charged Station Casinos with improper financial disclosure and illegal lobbying activities. The company agreed to pay a $5 million fine.</p>
<p>In 2004, Station Casinos was indicted on federal charges of racketeering and conspiracy to commit extortion. The case revolved around allegations that the company had paid off local law enforcement officials in order to secure permits for new casinos. Station Casinos eventually pleaded guilty to two felony charges and agreed to pay a $1 million fine.</p>
<p>More recently, in 2016, Station Casinos’ parent company, Red Rock Resorts, was hit with a class action lawsuit alleging that it had failed to properly disclose its relationships with online gaming companies.</p>
<p>So far, Red Rock Resorts has been able to fend off these lawsuits, but they are likely only a matter of time before more are filed.</p>
<h1 id="Station-Casinos’-Parent-Company-Focuses-on-Local-Markets"><a href="#Station-Casinos’-Parent-Company-Focuses-on-Local-Markets" class="headerlink" title="Station Casinos’ Parent Company Focuses on Local Markets"></a>Station Casinos’ Parent Company Focuses on Local Markets</h1><p>Station Casinos, the casino operator which emerged from bankruptcy in 2009 and was acquired by Red Rock Resorts in April, is now part of a larger organization with a renewed focus on local markets.</p>
<p>The parent company of Station Casinos, Red Rock Resorts, announced its Q2 earnings this week and revealed that it will be focusing on “organic growth through disciplined allocating capital to its best-in-class assets and pursuing bolt-on acquisitions.”</p>
<p>This news may come as a bit of a surprise to some as there had been speculation that Red Rock Resorts would be selling off Station Casinos. However, it appears that the parent company is committed to its casino subsidiary and believes there is still plenty of opportunity for growth in the local market.</p>
<p>According to the company’s CEO, Marc Schorr, “We are very pleased with our second quarter results and remain focused on our strategic priorities: growing organically through disciplined capital allocation to our best-in-class assets and pursuing bolt-on acquisitions; driving value creation for shareholders through strong free cash flow generation; and continuing to enhance the guest experience.”</p>
<p>In addition to its commitment to Station Casinos, Red Rock Resorts also announced that it has entered into an agreement to sell the Grand Victoria Casino in Elgin, Illinois for $280 million. This sale is expected to close by the end of 2017.</p>
<p>Red Rock Resorts’ decision to focus on local markets and pursue bolt-on acquisitions makes sense when you consider the current state of the casino industry. With increasing competition from surrounding states, casino operators need to be more nimble and able to react quickly in order to stay competitive. Additionally, given that gaming revenues have been declining nationwide, casino companies are looking for ways to drive profitability and increase shareholder value.</p>
<h1 id="Station-Casino’s-Parent-Company-Hopes-to-Expand-Operations"><a href="#Station-Casino’s-Parent-Company-Hopes-to-Expand-Operations" class="headerlink" title="Station Casino’s Parent Company Hopes to Expand Operations"></a>Station Casino’s Parent Company Hopes to Expand Operations</h1><h1 id="-3"><a href="#-3" class="headerlink" title=""></a></h1><p>The parent company of Station Casino’s is looking to expand its operations. The goal is to have the company’s brands in 20 states within the next five years.</p>
<p>The company, Red Rock Resorts, is looking to grow its operations with $1.5 billion in capital expenditures. $500 million of that will be used to complete the development of the company’s new property in Las Vegas.</p>
<p>Red Rock Resorts owns and operates 17 properties across 10 states. The company plans to use the majority of its capital expenditures to grow its presence in three key markets; California, Illinois, and Nevada.</p>
<p>In Illinois, Red Rock Resorts will open a property in Elgin this year. The casino will have 220 tables and 2,000 slots. In California, the company will open a hotel-casino in Downtown Sacramento. And finally, in Nevada, Red Rock Resorts will continue the development of its property on the Las Vegas Strip.</p>
<p>The expansion into these new markets comes as the gaming industry has seen some slowness recently due to increased regulation and competition from other forms of entertainment such as Netflix and online gaming.</p>
<p>Despite this slowdown, Red Rock Resort’s CEO believes there is still plenty of opportunity for growth in the gaming industry. “Our industry has faced some challenges in recent years but we remain bullish on our prospects,” he said. “We are committed to investing in our business and look forward to continuing our track record of delivering outstanding returns for our shareholders.”</p>
