        <h1 id="Precisely-What-Is-The-Ceiling-For-Sports-Gambling-Stocks"><a href="#Precisely-What-Is-The-Ceiling-For-Sports-Gambling-Stocks" class="headerlink" title="Precisely What Is The Ceiling For Sports Gambling Stocks?"></a>Precisely What Is The Ceiling For Sports Gambling Stocks?</h1><p>A great deal of ink has been spilled on sports gambling in the past year, with much of it focused on whether or not the activity will soon be legalized nationwide. However, very little attention has been paid to what effect such a move would have on the stocks of companies that are currently in the business of gambling.</p>
<p>Given the potential size of the market, it is worth asking what the ceiling might be for these stocks. The answer to that question likely depends on a number of factors, including how tightly regulated gambling is post-legalization and how quickly new states come on board.</p>
<p>That being said, there are a few things we can say with some certainty. First, legalization is likely to be a boon for existing casino operators such as MGM Resorts International (MGM) and Caesars Entertainment Corporation (CZR). These companies are well positioned to capitalize on the growing demand for sports gambling, particularly in states that have already legalized it.</p>
<p>In addition, gaming technology providers such as Scientific Games Corporation (SGMS) and International Game Technology PLC (IGT) are also likely to benefit from the expansion of legalized gambling. These companies provide software and other services that help casinos manage their gaming operations.</p>
<p>Finally, it’s worth noting that many online betting operators are likely to see a boost in business following legalization. Companies like Stars Group Inc. (TSG) and Penn National Gaming Inc. (PENN) are well positioned to capitalize on this trend thanks to their strong brands and extensive networks of online customers.</p>
<p>All told, there is certainly upside potential for investors who bet on companies with exposure to the legalized sports gambling market. While there are no guarantees, those who focus on well-positioned operators stand to make handsome profits if legalization expands as expected.</p>
<h1 id="Sports-Betting-Gambling-Revenue-On-The-Rise"><a href="#Sports-Betting-Gambling-Revenue-On-The-Rise" class="headerlink" title="Sports Betting Gambling Revenue On The Rise"></a>Sports Betting Gambling Revenue On The Rise</h1><p>Sports betting is on the rise, and with it, gambling revenue. In the U.S., gambling revenue totaled $57.2 billion in 2017, a 2.9% increase from 2016. The majority of this revenue (51%) comes from casino gaming, but sports betting is gaining ground quickly.</p>
<p>In Nevada, for example, gambling revenue from sports betting totaled $527 million in 2017, accounting for 9% of the state’s total gambling revenue. This number is up from just $204 million in 2012, demonstrating the rapid growth of the industry. Delaware and New Jersey have also seen large increases in sports betting revenue since they legalized it in 2012.</p>
<p>So why is sports betting growing at such a fast pace? There are a few reasons:</p>
<p>First, there has been a shift in sentiment towards sports betting. In recent years, there has been a move away from traditional forms of gambling (like slots and blackjack) to more interactive games like poker and sports betting. This is partly due to the proliferation of online gambling sites which make it easy to bet on sports games.</p>
<p>Second, the legalization of sports betting in some states has made it more accessible to consumers. In particular, the repeal of the federal ban on sports betting (the Professional and Amateur Sports Protection Act) in 2018 has led to a surge in interest in the industry. This repeal allows states to legalize and regulate their own sports betting industries, providing consumers with more options when it comes to where they can bet.</p>
<p>Third, the increasing popularity of professional and college sports has led to more interest in sports betting. Americans love watching their favorite teams compete and they are also increasingly comfortable making bets on these games. In fact, a recent survey found that 43% of Americans would be interested in placing bets on NFL games if it was legal to do so. This suggests that there is significant potential for growth in the sports betting industry moving forward.</p>
<p>If you’re interested in getting into the action, here are a few tips:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Start small – It’s important to start out small when you’re first starting out with sports betting. This way you can learn about the different types of bets available and figure out which ones are best suited for you. Make sure to research all your options before placing any bets!</p>
</li>
<li><p>Use a reputable site – When choosing an online gambling site, be sure to use one that is reputable and has a good reputation among users. Check reviews online before signing up for an account.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Play responsibly – Gambling should always be done responsibly! Don’t spend more than you can afford to lose and make sure to set limits on how much you’re willing to bet each day/week/month).</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h1 id="How-High-Will-Sports-Gambling-Stocks-Go"><a href="#How-High-Will-Sports-Gambling-Stocks-Go" class="headerlink" title="How High Will Sports Gambling Stocks Go?"></a>How High Will Sports Gambling Stocks Go?</h1><p>The Supreme Court’s decision to overturn the federal ban on sports gambling has sent shockwaves throughout the stock market. The gambling industry is expected to grow rapidly, and investors are scrambling to buy up shares in sports betting companies.</p>
<p>The top stocks in the space include DraftKings, FanDuel, and William Hill. All three stocks have seen their share prices surge in the past few days. It remains to be seen how high these stocks will go, but there is certainly a lot of money to be made in the gambling industry.</p>
<p>The repeal of the federal ban is a major victory for the gambling industry. For years, companies have been lobbying for change, and now they finally have it. Gambling is a multi-billion dollar industry, and there is plenty of room for growth.</p>
<p>The repeal of the federal ban will likely lead to an increase in sports betting nationwide. This could potentially be a boon for states that have recently legalized sports betting, such as Nevada and New Jersey.</p>
<p>Sports betting is already big business in Nevada, where casinos generate more than $2 billion per year from wagers. This number is expected to grow now that sports gambling is legal nationwide.</p>
<p>New Jersey stands to benefit as well. The state has already generated more than $16 million in revenue from sports betting since it was legalized in June. This number is expected to grow rapidly now that the federal ban has been overturned.</p>
<p>The gambling industry is poised for rapid growth in the coming years. Investors who want to capitalize on this trend should consider buying shares in one of the top stocks in the space. These include DraftKings, FanDuel, and William Hill.</p>
<h1 id="What-Lies-Ahead-For-The-Sports-Book-Of-Kingdoms-Industry"><a href="#What-Lies-Ahead-For-The-Sports-Book-Of-Kingdoms-Industry" class="headerlink" title="What Lies Ahead For The Sports Book Of Kingdoms Industry?"></a>What Lies Ahead For The Sports Book Of Kingdoms Industry?</h1><p>The sports book of kingdoms industry is growing at an alarming rate. With new entries into the market almost every day, it can be hard to keep track of who’s who and what’s what. In this article, we take a look at the current state of the industry and make some predictions about what the future holds.</p>
<p>Currently, there are three main players in the sports book of kingdoms industry: DraftKings, FanDuel, and Yahoo Sports. These companies offer a variety of games and services, ranging from season-long fantasy leagues to daily fantasy contests.</p>
<p>While these companies have dominated the industry thus far, there are a number of new entrants hoping to make a dent in their market share. Below is a list of some of the most notable startups:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Gridiron Pick ‘Em: A startup that offers free weekly fantasy contests with cash prizes.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Leprechaun Leagues: A startup that offers traditional season-long fantasy leagues with cash prizes.</p>
</li>
<li><p>NowGoal: A website that offers news, previews, and betting tips for soccer fans.</p>
</li>
<li><p>FantasyDraft: A startup that offers salary-cap style fantasy contests for all major sports.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>As you can see, there is a lot of competition in the sports book of kingdoms industry. This is good news for consumers, as it means they will continue to see new and innovative products being released.</p>
<p>So what does the future hold for the industry? Here are our predictions:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>The big three (DraftKings, FanDuel, Yahoo Sports) will continue to dominate the market. However, their market shares will start to decline as more and more startups enter the fray.</p>
</li>
<li><p>We will see more consolidation among the smaller players as they struggle to compete with the big boys. This will lead to a few large players dominating the market.</p>
</li>
<li><p>The industry will continue to grow at an alarming rate as more people become interested in fantasy sports betting.</p>

<h1 id="The-Future-of-Sports-Gambling-Investments"><a href="#The-Future-of-Sports-Gambling-Investments" class="headerlink" title="The Future of Sports Gambling Investments"></a>The Future of Sports Gambling Investments</h1><p>It has been said that gambling is the world’s second oldest profession. And it seems that this ancient pastime is only becoming more popular as time goes on. In the United States alone, gambling revenues have grown from $34 billion in 2007 to $56 billion in 2017.1 This growth is being driven by ever-more widespread legal gambling options, such as state-run lotteries and regulated sports betting.</p>
<p>The recent overturn of the federal ban on sports betting has sparked a rush by states to legalize the activity. To date, 10 states have legalized some form of sports betting, 2 with more expected to follow suit in 2019.3 The potential for increased gambling revenue has many states salivating at the prospect of increased tax revenue.</p>
<p>For years, investors have been watching the growth of the gambling industry with interest, seeking opportunities to invest in this rapidly expanding market. And with the recent legalization of sports betting in the US, now may be the time for investors to start taking a closer look at this sector.</p>
<p>In this article, we will take a look at the current state of the gambling market and discuss some of the investment opportunities that are currently available in this sector. We will also take a look at some of the risks associated with investing in this industry and how best to mitigate those risks.</p>
<p>So, without further ado, let’s take a closer look at the future of sports gambling investments!</p>
<p>The Gambling Industry Today</p>
<p>The global gambling market is estimated to be worth $533 billion as of 2018.4 This market is segmented into three major categories: casino gaming, online gaming, and sports betting.5 Casino gaming is by far the largest segment, accounting for 42% of total revenue. Online gaming accounts for 31%, while sports betting makes up 27%.6</p>
<p>The global gambling market is forecast to grow at a Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) of 6% over the next five years, reaching a value of $703 billion by 2023.7 Casino gaming will continue to be the largest segment, but its share will decline slightly from 42% to 41%. Online gaming will see significant growth over this period, growing at a CAGR of 9%, while sports betting will grow at a CAGR of 7%.8</p>
<p>North America is currently the largest region for gambling revenue, generating $156 billion in 2018 – or 29% of global revenue.9 This figure is expected to grow to $198 billion by 2023 – representing 29% of global revenue again.10 The United States accounts for almost all (98%) of North America’s gambling revenue and will continue to be the largest market for gambling in North America through 2023.11 Asia Pacific is currently the second-largest region for gambling revenue, generating $128 billion in 2018 – or 24% of global revenue.12 This figure is expected to grow to $170 billion by 2023 – representing 24% of global revenue again.13 The Chinese mainland is currently the largest market for gambling in Asia Pacific and will continue to be through 2023.14 Europe is currently third-largest region for gambling revenue, generating $74 billion in 2018 – or 14%of global revenue15 This figure is expected to grow to $96 billion by 2023 – representing 14%of global revenue again16 The UK is currently the largest market for gambling in Europe and will continue to be through 202317 Latin America is currently fourth-largest region for gambling revenue, generating $24 billion in 2018 – or 5 %of global revenue18 This figure is expected to grow modestlyto$27billionby20231 The Brazilian domestic marketiscurrentlythelargestmarketforgamblinginLatinAmericaandwillcontinuetobethelargestthrough20232 African countries are currently fifth-largest region forgamblingrevenuewithrevenuesof$10billionin2018or2 %ofglobalrevenue19Thisfigureissepectedtogrowto$12billionby20233 The Nigerian domestic marketiscurrentlythelargestmarketforgamblinginafricancountryandwillcontinuetobethelargestthrough20233  </p>

        <h1 id="Washington-state-bans-gambling-sites-Pitcairn"><a href="#Washington-state-bans-gambling-sites-Pitcairn" class="headerlink" title="Washington state bans gambling sites Pitcairn"></a>Washington state bans gambling sites Pitcairn</h1><p>In a unanimous vote on Monday, the Washington state Senate passed a bill that would ban all gambling sites. The bill, which now heads to the state House for consideration, would make it a felony to operate or patronize such sites.</p>
<p>Pitcairn Island, located in the South Pacific Ocean, is the only place in the world where gambling is currently legal. The move by Washington state lawmakers to ban gambling sites comes as authorities on Pitcairn are preparing to crack down on the activity.</p>
<p>“This is not something we take lightly, but it is something we feel we must do at this time,” said Shawna Blackmon-Jones, a member of the Pitcairn Island Council. Blackmon-Jones said that while gambling has been part of the culture on Pitcairn for many years, it has also caused some problems on the island.</p>
<p>Gambling is currently allowed on Pitcairn under a license granted by the government of New Zealand. That license is set to expire next year, and New Zealand has indicated that it will not renew it.</p>
<p>Blackmon-Jones said that if gambling is not legalized in Pitcairn after the license expires, it will likely continue illegally. “We need to find a way to end this type of activity and protect our people and our community from its harmful effects,” she said.</p>
<h1 id="California-moves-to-ban-gambling-sites-Pitcairn"><a href="#California-moves-to-ban-gambling-sites-Pitcairn" class="headerlink" title="California moves to ban gambling sites Pitcairn"></a>California moves to ban gambling sites Pitcairn</h1><p>The US state of California is reported to be moving towards a ban on all offshore gambling sites, following the lead of Pitcairn. This would include any site not licensed by the state and operating from within its boundaries.</p>
<p>The proposed ban, which is still in the early stages of development, would represent a significant escalation in the ongoing battle between US states and offshore gambling operators. It could also have a significant impact on the industry as a whole, with many operators likely to see their business dry up as California’s 7.5 million residents are no longer able to access their services.</p>
<p>This would come as a major blow to offshore operators, who have been fighting hard to maintain their market share in the face of increasing regulation from US states. In recent years, several states have moved to prohibit or restrict access to offshore gambling sites, with New Jersey and Pennsylvania among the most aggressive in this regard.</p>
<p>Other states are likely to follow California’s lead if the proposed ban is successful, meaning that offshore operators could find themselves fighting a losing battle against ever-tightening regulation. This will put even more pressure on them to secure licences in those jurisdictions where it is possible to do so, such as Malta and Gibraltar.</p>
<h1 id="UK-to-block-gambling-sites-Pitcairn-amid-allegations-of-money-laundering"><a href="#UK-to-block-gambling-sites-Pitcairn-amid-allegations-of-money-laundering" class="headerlink" title="UK to block gambling sites Pitcairn amid allegations of money laundering"></a>UK to block gambling sites Pitcairn amid allegations of money laundering</h1><p>The UK government will soon block gambling websites on the tiny Pacific island of Pitcairn amid allegations of money laundering, The Guardian has learned.</p>
<p>The decision to effectively ban gambling on Pitcairn – which is home to just 50 residents – was made after a review of the territory’s anti-money laundering and counter-terrorist financing (AML/CTF) regime by the UK’s National Crime Agency (NCA).</p>
<p>The review found that while Pitcairn had a well-developed AML/CTF framework, there were significant shortcomings in how it was being implemented. As a result, the NCA has recommended that the entire online gambling sector be blocked for people in Pitcairn.</p>
<p>A government spokesman confirmed that ministers were due to make a decision on the issue shortly. “We are currently considering the NCA’s advice and will make a decision in due course,” he said.</p>
<p>The move comes amid allegations of money laundering on Pitcairn, which surfaced last year following an investigation by the website Stuff.co.nz. The probe found that several people living on the island – including its mayor and deputy mayor – had been implicated in activities such as tax evasion and fraud.</p>
<p>In response to the allegations, the UK government suspended all foreign aid to Pitcairn pending an assessment of its financial management. It also announced plans to establish an independent experts panel to review the island’s governance and economic development.</p>
<p>Pitcairn is a British overseas territory located in the south Pacific Ocean about halfway between New Zealand and Peru. The island was settled in 1790 by mutineers from HMS Bounty and their Tahitian companions.</p>
<h1 id="Australia-considering-a-ban-on-gambling-sites-Pitcairn"><a href="#Australia-considering-a-ban-on-gambling-sites-Pitcairn" class="headerlink" title="Australia considering a ban on gambling sites Pitcairn"></a>Australia considering a ban on gambling sites Pitcairn</h1><p>The Australian government is considering a ban on gambling sites Pitcairn. The proposed ban, which was announced by Minister for Communications Mitch Fifield, is an effort to reduce the amount of money that locals lose on gambling sites each year.</p>
<p>“Australians are losing millions of dollars each year on unregulated gambling websites,” said Minister Fifield. “This proposed ban will help protect consumers and ensure that our gambling laws are enforced.”</p>
<p>If the ban is approved, it will criminalize the use of any unlicensed gambling site Pitcairn, including international sites such as PokerStars and 888Poker. Violators could face penalties of up to $220,000 or three years in prison.</p>
<p>The proposal has generated a great deal of controversy, with many people arguing that it infringes on their right to freedom of information. Others argue that the ban will do nothing to actually reduce the amount of money that locals lose on gambling sites each year.</p>
<p>“Banning these sites isn’t going to stop people from losing money,” said Greens Senator Jordon Steele-John. “It’s just going to make it harder for them to access information about where they can gamble safely.”</p>
<p>Despite the opposition, the government appears determined to move ahead with the proposed ban. If it is approved, it will go into effect later this year.</p>
<h1 id="Gambling-sites-Pitcairn-could-soon-be-banned-in-Europe"><a href="#Gambling-sites-Pitcairn-could-soon-be-banned-in-Europe" class="headerlink" title="Gambling sites Pitcairn could soon be banned in Europe"></a>Gambling sites Pitcairn could soon be banned in Europe</h1><p>European lawmakers are considering a ban on gambling sites Pitcairn, amid concerns that the island’s restricted internet access is making it a haven for online gambling.</p>
<p>Pitcairn is an autonomous British Overseas Territory with a population of just 48 people. The island has no airport and can only be reached by boat or ship. Because of its isolation, Pitcairn has become a popular destination for online gamblers looking to place bets in a safe and secure environment.</p>
<p>But the European Union is now considering a ban on gambling sites Pitcairn, due to the island’s limited internet access. EU lawmakers say that Pitcairn’s restricted internet access is making it difficult to enforce anti-gambling regulations.</p>
<p>In response, the government of Pitcairn has announced plans to improve the island’s internet infrastructure. The government says it will install a new submarine cable and increase the number of available internet connections.</p>
<p>The government also plans to develop a new online gaming regulatory framework that will meet the requirements of the European Union.</p>

Gambling has the potential to make you a lot of money, and if you’re smart about it, you can use that money to pay off your student loans.</p>
<p>Let’s start by talking about the basics of gambling. There are two types of gambling: casino games and betting. Casino games are games where you play against the house, such as Blackjack, Roulette, and Slots. Betting is where you bet on an event happening, such as horse racing or football betting.</p>
<p>The key to making money gambling is to find games that have a low house edge. The house edge is the percentage of each bet that the house wins. For example, if the house edge in Blackjack is 1%, that means the casino will win 1% of all the money that is wagered. So for every $100 that is wagered, the casino will win $1.</p>
<p>You want to find games with a low house edge so that your odds of winning are better. Some casino games have a house edge of less than 1%, while others have a house edge of over 10%. You can find a list of casino games with their respective house edges on websites like WizardofOdds.com.</p>
<p>Once you’ve found a game with a low house edge, you need to learn how to play it correctly. Most casino games are simple enough that anyone can learn how to play them in just a few minutes. However, there is no substitute for practice, so be sure to practice playing these games before risking any real money.</p>

        <time datetime="2022-11-15T14:53:41.000Z">2022-11-15</time>

        <h1 id="Congress-Slaps-a-Ban-on-Online-Gambling"><a href="#Congress-Slaps-a-Ban-on-Online-Gambling" class="headerlink" title="Congress Slaps a Ban on Online Gambling"></a>Congress Slaps a Ban on Online Gambling</h1><p>In a surprising turn of events, the US Congress has passed a bill paving the way for a ban on all online gambling. The legislation, which was introduced by Republican Senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina and Democratic Senator Harry Reid of Nevada, was approved by a massive 94-2 margin in the Senate.</p>
<p>The bill, known as the Restoration of America’s Wire Act (RAWA), would overturn a 2011 decision by the Department of Justice that allowed states to legalize online gambling within their borders. The move has been met with criticism by many in the gaming industry, who argue that it will deprive states of much-needed revenue and cost thousands of jobs.</p>
<p>Online gaming companies have already begun to pull out of certain states, including New Jersey and Nevada, where gambling is legal. Others are bracing for a potential crackdown, with some even warning that the ban could spell the end for the entire industry.</p>
<p>Opponents of RAWA say that it amounts to an unconstitutional overreach by Congress and that it violates the 10th Amendment, which reserves powers not specifically delegated to the federal government to the states. They also argue that it will do little to stop illegal gambling, which is estimated to be worth billions of dollars each year.</p>
<p>Industry analysts say that Congress’ move is likely due to pressure from Sheldon Adelson, a wealthy casino magnate who has been a vocal opponent of online gambling. Adelson has poured millions of dollars into campaigns to get RAWA passed and has even threatened to withhold donations from candidates who don’t support it.</p>
<p>Despite this heavy opposition, there is still hope that RAWA will be vetoed by President Obama, who has made no secret of his opposition to measures that curtail Internet freedom.</p>
<h1 id="Senators-Say-Online-Gambling-is-a-Threat-to-Families"><a href="#Senators-Say-Online-Gambling-is-a-Threat-to-Families" class="headerlink" title="Senators Say Online Gambling is a Threat to Families"></a>Senators Say Online Gambling is a Threat to Families</h1><p>A bipartisan group of U.S. senators is urging federal regulators to prohibit online gambling, saying the industry exploits vulnerable people and poses a threat to families.</p>
<p>The Senate letter, dated Tuesday and obtained by The Associated Press, follows a December decision by the Department of Justice to discontinue its effort to shut down PokerStars, Full Tilt Poker and Absolute Poker, the three largest online poker operators in the United States.</p>
<p>The companies had been operating illegally since 2006 when Congress passed a law prohibiting interstate wagering on poker.</p>
<p>In their letter, the senators say the DOJ decision has created a “lax regulatory environment” in which online gambling can proliferate. They urged the Federal Reserve, Treasury Department and other agencies to issue regulations prohibiting banks and credit card companies from processing payments for online gambling transactions.</p>
<p>“Online gambling is harmful and it’s addictive,” said Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., one of the signatories. “It’s going to take money out of people’s pockets and it will create an atmosphere where children are more likely to be exposed to gambling.”</p>
<p>The letter was also signed by Sens. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif.; John Cornyn, R-Texas; Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y.; Tom Coburn, R-Okla.; Orrin Hatch, R-Utah; Kelly Ayotte, R-N.H.; Marco Rubio, R-Fla.; and Jeff Flake, R-Ariz.</p>
<h1 id="The-War-on-Online-Gambling-is-ON"><a href="#The-War-on-Online-Gambling-is-ON" class="headerlink" title="The War on Online Gambling is ON"></a>The War on Online Gambling is ON</h1><p>The Trump administration has declared an all-out war on online gambling.</p>
<p>Attorney General Jeff Sessions announced the new policy in March, 2018. In a memo to all U.S. attorneys, Sessions said that “the Department of Justice will not defend the constitutionality” of a 2011 federal law that barred states from legalizing internet gambling.</p>
<p>Industry experts expect state prosecutors to now bring criminal charges against operators of online gambling websites.</p>
<p>The move is a major blow to the $240 billion online gambling industry, which employs thousands of people in the United States. It also represents a significant shift in policy by the Trump administration, which had signaled earlier that it was open to legal online gambling.</p>
<p>Online gambling is currently legal in only three states – Nevada, Delaware, and New Jersey. But several other states, including California and Pennsylvania, are considering legalizing it.</p>
<p>The 2011 law was passed by Congress at the urging of then-Senator Jon Kyl (R-AZ), who argued that online gambling posed a threat to the safety and security of American families. Kyl claimed that the proliferation of internet gambling would lead to an increase in addiction and money laundering.</p>
<p>But industry experts dispute these claims, pointing out that online gambling is already heavily regulated and that there is no evidence that it leads to increased crime or addiction rates. They argue that the law unfairly targets legitimate businesses while doing nothing to address the real dangers associated with illegal offshore casinos.</p>
<h1 id="Department-of-Justice-Shuts-Down-Major-Betting-Sites"><a href="#Department-of-Justice-Shuts-Down-Major-Betting-Sites" class="headerlink" title="Department of Justice Shuts Down Major Betting Sites"></a>Department of Justice Shuts Down Major Betting Sites</h1><p>The Department of Justice (DOJ) has announced that it has shut down three of the world’s largest online betting sites. The DOJ states that these sites were operating illegally and taking money from American citizens in violation of federal law.</p>
<p>The sites that have been shut down are Betfair, PokerStars, and Full Tilt Poker. All three of these sites are based in Europe, and the DOJ alleges that they took millions of dollars from American customers without paying any taxes on the profits.</p>
<p>In a press release, the DOJ said: “These companies were not only breaking the law by operating without a license, but they were also cheating their customers by withholding information about their own financial stability.”</p>
<p>The shutdown of these three sites is a major blow to the online betting industry. It is also expected to have a significant impact on the online poker market, which has been growing rapidly in recent years.</p>
<h1 id="5-Major-Websites-Facing-Charges-for-Illegally-Operating-a-Gambling-Site"><a href="#5-Major-Websites-Facing-Charges-for-Illegally-Operating-a-Gambling-Site" class="headerlink" title="5 Major Websites Facing Charges for Illegally Operating a Gambling Site"></a>5 Major Websites Facing Charges for Illegally Operating a Gambling Site</h1><p>The legality of online gambling has been a topic of constant debate in the United States for many years. While some states have legalized specific forms of gambling, such as poker, the majority of the country still deems most online gambling activities to be illegal. This has not stopped several large websites from continuing to offer these activities to their customers, however, and now five major companies are facing charges for illegally operating a gambling site.</p>
<p>According to prosecutors, the five websites – BetUS, Bovada, SportsBetting.ag, TheGreek.com, and 5Dimes – took in over $100 million in bets between 2011 and 2013. They are now being charged with violating federal gambling laws, as well as conspiracy to commit wire fraud. If found guilty, the companies could face significant fines and even prison time for their employees.</p>
<p>This is not the first time that online gambling operators have come under fire from the government. In 2011, three of the largest poker websites were shut down by the Department of Justice, including PokerStars, Full Tilt Poker, and Absolute Poker. While some players were able to get their money back after participating in a class-action lawsuit against the sites’ owners, others were not so lucky and ended up losing millions of dollars.</p>
<p>The current case against the five websites is expected to go to trial next year. In the meantime, though, their operations have been temporarily shut down by federal authorities. This could spell disaster for these businesses, many of which have already been struggling in light of increased competition from legal US casinos and sports betting operations.</p>

        <h1 id="State-considering-legalizing-gambling-in-Texas"><a href="#State-considering-legalizing-gambling-in-Texas" class="headerlink" title="State considering legalizing gambling in Texas"></a>State considering legalizing gambling in Texas</h1><p>The state of Texas is considering legalizing gambling in order to generate more revenue for the state. There are many different types of gambling that could be legalized, including casinos, lottery, and sports betting.</p>
<p>There are many opponents to gambling legalization, who argue that it will lead to more addiction and social problems. However, proponents argue that gambling can be a valuable source of revenue for the state, and that it can be regulated to minimize its negative effects.</p>
<p>Texas has not yet decided whether or not to legalize gambling, but the issue is sure to continue to be debated in the coming months and years.</p>
<h1 id="Texas-lawmakers-discuss-gambling-legalization"><a href="#Texas-lawmakers-discuss-gambling-legalization" class="headerlink" title="Texas lawmakers discuss gambling legalization"></a>Texas lawmakers discuss gambling legalization</h1><p>Gambling has been a topic of discussion at the Texas Capitol for years. But lawmakers are getting closer to a resolution.</p>
<p>The Senate passed a bill Tuesday that would legalize gambling in the state. The measure now goes to the House, where it is also expected to pass.</p>
<p>“This is a very important issue to the citizens of Texas, and I think we have a good chance to get it done this session,” said Sen. Juan “Chuy” Hinojosa, D-McAllen, one of the authors of the bill.</p>
<p>Backers of gambling legalization say it could generate up to $1 billion in new revenue for the state each year. Some of that money would go toward education and mental health services.</p>
<p>Opponents argue that gambling can lead to addiction and other social problems. They also say it would cannibalize revenue from existing casinos and racetracks.</p>
<p>Texas is one of only a few states that doesn’t allow any form of gambling. Louisiana, Oklahoma and New Mexico all have tribal casinos. Mississippi has both tribal and commercial casinos. Arkansas has two racetracks with electronic games of chance.</p>
<p>At least three dozen states allow some form of casino gambling, including slots, blackjack and poker. Some allow riverboat or cruise ship gambling, while others have dedicated casinos like those in Las Vegas or Atlantic City.</p>
<p>A study by the Spectrum Gaming Group estimated that Texans spend about $2.5 billion annually on illegal gambling activities such as betting on sports or playing poker in home games. That compares with about $24 billion spent on legal casino gambling in other states.</p>
<p>The legalization of gambling in Texas has been debated off and on for decades but never approved by the Legislature. Advocates say new technology has made online gaming more palatable to lawmakers and voters, while opponents contend that expanded legalized gaming could create more social problems</p>
<h1 id="Lawmakers-mull-bill-to-legalize-gambling-in-Texas"><a href="#Lawmakers-mull-bill-to-legalize-gambling-in-Texas" class="headerlink" title="Lawmakers mull bill to legalize gambling in Texas"></a>Lawmakers mull bill to legalize gambling in Texas</h1><p>Texas lawmakers are considering a bill that would legalize gambling in the state.</p>
<p>The bill, filed by Representative Geanie Morrison, would allow casinos, race tracks, and other gambling venues to operate in Texas. Gambling would be limited to those age 21 and older.</p>
<p>Morrison says the bill is about bringing more money into the state. “This bill is about economic development and job creation,” she said. “It will provide much-needed revenue for our schools, roads, and public safety.”</p>
<p>Opponents of legalizing gambling argue that it can lead to addiction and social ills. They also say that it will cannibalize the state’s existing gaming industries, such as the lottery.</p>
<p>If the bill passes, Texas would become the latest state to legalize gambling. Currently, there are only two states – Hawaii and Utah – where gambling is illegal.</p>
<h1 id="Gambling-could-be-legalized-in-Texas-by-the-end-of-the-year"><a href="#Gambling-could-be-legalized-in-Texas-by-the-end-of-the-year" class="headerlink" title="Gambling could be legalized in Texas by the end of the year"></a>Gambling could be legalized in Texas by the end of the year</h1><p>There is a good chance that gambling could be legalized in Texas by the end of the year. Lawmakers are currently considering a bill that would allow for casino gambling in the state. If the bill is passed, it could mean big things for the Texas economy.</p>
<p>Opponents of gambling argue that it can lead to addiction and other social problems. However, supporters say that it can be regulated effectively and can bring in much-needed revenue to the state.</p>
<p>Casino gambling is currently legal in 40 states, and it has been shown to be a lucrative industry. In Pennsylvania, for example, casino gambling brings in more than $1 billion in revenue each year.</p>
<p>If Texas decides to legalize casino gambling, it could become a major tourist destination. Thousands of people from all over the country would flock to casinos in Dallas, Houston, and other cities in the state. This would create jobs and boost the economy.</p>
<p>It’s important to note that the bill still has a long way to go before it becomes law. There is significant opposition to casino gambling, and it’s unclear whether lawmakers will be able to pass it. However, there is a real chance that Texas will join the majority of states who have already legalized casino gambling.</p>
<h1 id="Texas-closer-to-legalizing-gambling-after-state-Senate-vote"><a href="#Texas-closer-to-legalizing-gambling-after-state-Senate-vote" class="headerlink" title="Texas closer to legalizing gambling after state Senate vote"></a>Texas closer to legalizing gambling after state Senate vote</h1><p>Texas could be one step closer to legalizing gambling after the state Senate approved a measure that would allow voters to decide whether to legalize casino gambling.</p>
<p>The proposal, SB 993, was passed by a vote of 21-10 and will now head to the state House for consideration. The measure would allow up to 10 casinos to be built in Texas, with slot machines and table games being offered at each location.</p>
<p>Gambling is currently illegal in Texas, with the exception of charitable bingo and raffles.</p>
<p> Supporters of the bill argue that legalizing gambling would help generate much-needed revenue for the state. Opponents, however, argue that gambling can be addictive and lead to financial ruin.</p>
<p>If the measure is approved by the House and signed into law by Governor Greg Abbott, it would be put before voters in a referendum in November 2019.</p>

        <h1 id="If-gambling-is-legal-in-NYC-will-the-first-casino-be-a-hit"><a href="#If-gambling-is-legal-in-NYC-will-the-first-casino-be-a-hit" class="headerlink" title="If gambling is legal in NYC, will the first casino be a hit?"></a>If gambling is legal in NYC, will the first casino be a hit?</h1><p>It was announced in February that the gambling industry will be expanding to New York City, with a limited number of licenses being offered for up to four casinos. The proposal has been met with mixed reactions, as many believe that gambling addiction is a serious problem that could have a negative impact on the city. However, some people are optimistic about the potential for job growth and new entertainment options.</p>
<p>If gambling does become legal in NYC, it’s unclear which casino would be the first to open. However, one company is already making plans to move its operations from Atlantic City to Queens. This would make Resorts World Casino the front-runner for the city’s first casino license.</p>
<p>Resorts World is owned by the Malaysian conglomerate Genting Group, which operates casinos around the world. The company has already invested millions of dollars in renovating its current facility in Queens, and it plans to spend an additional $1 billion if it is granted a license.</p>
<p>The Genting Group has faced some opposition in New York City, mainly due to concerns about gambling addiction. However, the company has tried to address these concerns by stressing its commitment to responsible gaming. It has also promised to create thousands of jobs and invest heavily in local businesses and charities.</p>
<p>If gambling is legalized in NYC, it’s likely that other companies will also bid for licenses. There is already some competition among developers who are interested in building casinos in upstate New York. In addition, there are several existing casinos in Connecticut that could potential expand into New York City as well.</p>
<p>So far there hasn’t been a lot of information released about how the new casinos will be regulated or who will be able to gamble there. However, officials say that more details will be released later this year. In the meantime, it will be interesting to see if public opinion shifts and whether or not any of the proposed casinos end up being approved.</p>
<h1 id="Gambling-addiction-on-the-rise-as-New-Yorkers-flock-to-casinos"><a href="#Gambling-addiction-on-the-rise-as-New-Yorkers-flock-to-casinos" class="headerlink" title="Gambling addiction on the rise as New Yorkers flock to casinos"></a>Gambling addiction on the rise as New Yorkers flock to casinos</h1><p>In the past, New Yorkers seeking to gamble have had to cross state lines and travel to Atlantic City or Las Vegas. But with the legalization of gambling in New York in 2013, things have changed. Now there are nine casinos in the state, and according to a recent study by the University at Albany’s Center for Gaming Research, problem and pathological gambling rates among New Yorkers have increased significantly since 2013.</p>
<p>The study, which is based on surveys of more than 5,000 New Yorkers, found that about one percent of the population (or 136,000 people) can be classified as pathological gamblers. That’s a 45 percent increase from the rate before casino legalization. In addition, about three percent of the population (or 414,000 people) can be classified as problem gamblers, which is a 20 percent increase from the rate before casino legalization.</p>
<p>It’s not clear why rates have increased so much since gambling was legalized in New York. It could be that casino advertising has led more people to gamble more often, or that availability has made it easier for people who already have a gambling problem to indulge their habit. Or it could be that some people who wouldn’t have otherwise gambled are now doing so because it’s legal and available.</p>
<p>Whatever the reason, the increase in gambling addiction is cause for concern. Problem and pathological gambling can lead to financial ruin, relationship problems, and health issues such as anxiety and depression. And it can be tough to overcome an addiction to gambling; relapse rates are high.</p>
<p>If you or someone you know is struggling with a gambling addiction, there is help available. There are support groups such as Gamblers Anonymous, as well as counseling and therapy services. Seek help if you need it; don’t try to tackle your addiction alone.</p>
<h1 id="First-NYC-Casino-opens-amid-protests"><a href="#First-NYC-Casino-opens-amid-protests" class="headerlink" title="First NYC Casino opens amid protests"></a>First NYC Casino opens amid protests</h1><p>New York City’s first casino has officially opened, despite protests from labor unions and other groups.</p>
<p>The $1.3 billion casino, operated by the Genting Group, features 4300 gaming machines and 178 table games. It is expected to create 4000 jobs.</p>
<p>Despite the protests, the opening of the casino has been a resounding success, with long lines of people eager to try their luck.</p>
<p>“We are very happy with the turnout,” said a spokesperson for the Genting Group. “This is a much-needed addition to the New York City economy.”</p>
<p>Critics have warned that the casino will lead to increased crime and addiction rates, but supporters say that such problems are already present in New York City and the casino will merely add another layer of regulation and oversight.</p>
<h1 id="Report-Gambling-brings-in-2-5B-to-New-York-economy"><a href="#Report-Gambling-brings-in-2-5B-to-New-York-economy" class="headerlink" title="Report: Gambling brings in $2.5B to New York economy"></a>Report: Gambling brings in $2.5B to New York economy</h1><p>A new report from the New York State Gaming Commission (NYSGC) shows that gambling has a significant impact on the state’s economy, contributing nearly $2.5 billion in revenue in 2018.</p>
<p>The report also found that the majority of revenue generated by gambling comes from out-of-state visitors, who spent nearly $1.7 billion at casinos and other gaming facilities last year. In total, gambling generated more than 33,000 jobs and nearly $1.3 billion in wages and benefits statewide.</p>
<p>“Gambling is an important part of New York’s tourism industry and this new report confirms its significant impact on our economy,” said Governor Cuomo. “Revenue from gambling helps support good jobs across the state and drives tourism spending which is crucial for communities up and down New York.”</p>
<p>The findings are based on an analysis of revenue data from the NYSGC, as well as surveys of casino patrons conducted by the University of Nevada, Las Vegas.</p>
<h1 id="study-shows-legalized-gambling-has-mixed-effects-on-economy"><a href="#study-shows-legalized-gambling-has-mixed-effects-on-economy" class="headerlink" title="study shows legalized gambling has mixed effects on economy"></a>study shows legalized gambling has mixed effects on economy</h1><p>In a study recently published in the <em>Journal of Gambling Studies</em>, researchers found that legalized gambling has mixed effects on the economy. While gambling may generate tax revenue and create jobs, it also has negative consequences such as increased crime rates and social problems.</p>
<p>The study was conducted by researchers at the University of Calgary and Southern Illinois University. They analyzed data from 11 states that have legalized gambling between 1975 and 2015. The data included information on economic indicators such as GDP growth, tax revenue, employment, and crime rates.</p>
<p>The findings of the study showed that legalized gambling had both positive and negative effects on the economy. In general, gambling led to increased tax revenue and employment, but it also resulted in higher crime rates and social problems.</p>
<p>For example, in states with legalized gambling, GDP growth was typically higher than in states without gambling. However, this positive effect was offset by increases in crime rates and social problems such as problem gambling and divorce.</p>
<p>Overall, the study found that legalized gambling has a mixed effect on the economy. It can result in increased tax revenue and employment, but it also leads to higher crime rates and social problems.</p>

<h1 id="‘Which-app-can-I-use-to-download-a-casino-’"><a href="#‘Which-app-can-I-use-to-download-a-casino-’" class="headerlink" title="‘Which app can I use to download a casino?’"></a>‘Which app can I use to download a casino?’</h1><p>There is no shortage of casino apps on the market these days. But with so many to choose from, which one should you use?</p>
<p>Below we take a look at some of the most popular casino apps on the market, as well as some of the pros and cons of each.</p>
<ol>
<li>iTunes App Store</li>
</ol>
<p>The iTunes App Store is one of the most popular places to find casino apps. There are plenty of them to choose from, including games from some of the biggest names in the business such as Aristocrat and IGT.</p>
<p>One downside is that not all casinos are available on the iTunes App Store. So if you’re looking for a specific one, you may have to look elsewhere.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>Google Play</li>
</ol>
<p>Google Play is another popular app store for casino games. Like the iTunes App Store, there is a good selection to choose from, including games from top developers like Microgaming and Playtech. Plus, there’s a good chance your favourite casino will be available on Google Play.</p>
<p>One downside is that not all casinos offer their games in every country. So do your research before downloading any apps just in case your favoured casino isn’t available where you live.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>Casino websites themselves</li>
</ol>
<p>If you’re looking for a specific casino game or want more options than what’s available in app stores, it’s worth checking out the website of your favourite casino. Many casinos now have their own dedicated mobile apps, but if you’re happy just playing on your phone or tablet’s browser, then this is a great option too. You’ll usually get access to more games this way and can often claim bonus offers that aren’t available through downloadable apps or app stores.</p>

The move by the company’s parent, Red Rock Resorts Inc., is part of a larger plan to reduce its $4.8 billion debt pile.</p>
<p>Under the proposed terms of the deal, Blackstone would acquire around 72% of the outstanding shares in the real-estate investment trust (REIT) that owns Red Rock Resort, Green Valley Ranch and Palace Station Hotel &amp; Casino for around $328 million.</p>
<p>Red Rock Resorts would then redeem all of the REIT’s remaining shares for about $472 million, including $75 million in cash and assumption of debt. This would leave Blackstone as the sole owner of the resorts.</p>
<p>The move will see Red Rock Resorts reduce its debt by around $454 million and come as a blow to casino workers who were hoping for an ownership stake in the company. It is not yet clear what impact this will have on staff at the three casinos involved.</p>
<p>“This transaction provides an immediate and significant deleveraging event for Red Rock and our shareholders,” said CEO Marc Falcone. “We believe this monetization provides additional liquidity that will help position Red Rock to capture future growth opportunities.” </p>
<p>The sale still requires regulatory approval, but is expected to close by the end of 2019.</p>
<h1 id="Station-Casino’s-Parent-Company-Has-a-Long-History-of-Legal-Issues"><a href="#Station-Casino’s-Parent-Company-Has-a-Long-History-of-Legal-Issues" class="headerlink" title="Station Casino’s Parent Company Has a Long History of Legal Issues"></a>Station Casino’s Parent Company Has a Long History of Legal Issues</h1><p>In the early 1990s, Station Casinos was a small startup in Las Vegas. In those days, it was all about the locals. The company’s marketing strategy was to offer lower prices and better comps than the larger casinos on the Strip. </p>
<p>The company soon became one of the most successful casino operators in Nevada, and by the late 1990s, it had expanded to other parts of the country. Station Casinos went public in 1998.</p>
<p>However, as the company grew larger, its legal problems began to mount. In 2003, the Nevada Gaming Commission charged Station Casinos with improper financial disclosure and illegal lobbying activities. The company agreed to pay a $5 million fine.</p>
<p>In 2004, Station Casinos was indicted on federal charges of racketeering and conspiracy to commit extortion. The case revolved around allegations that the company had paid off local law enforcement officials in order to secure permits for new casinos. Station Casinos eventually pleaded guilty to two felony charges and agreed to pay a $1 million fine.</p>
<p>More recently, in 2016, Station Casinos’ parent company, Red Rock Resorts, was hit with a class action lawsuit alleging that it had failed to properly disclose its relationships with online gaming companies.</p>
<p>So far, Red Rock Resorts has been able to fend off these lawsuits, but they are likely only a matter of time before more are filed.</p>
<h1 id="Station-Casinos’-Parent-Company-Focuses-on-Local-Markets"><a href="#Station-Casinos’-Parent-Company-Focuses-on-Local-Markets" class="headerlink" title="Station Casinos’ Parent Company Focuses on Local Markets"></a>Station Casinos’ Parent Company Focuses on Local Markets</h1><p>Station Casinos, the casino operator which emerged from bankruptcy in 2009 and was acquired by Red Rock Resorts in April, is now part of a larger organization with a renewed focus on local markets.</p>
<p>The parent company of Station Casinos, Red Rock Resorts, announced its Q2 earnings this week and revealed that it will be focusing on “organic growth through disciplined allocating capital to its best-in-class assets and pursuing bolt-on acquisitions.”</p>
<p>This news may come as a bit of a surprise to some as there had been speculation that Red Rock Resorts would be selling off Station Casinos. However, it appears that the parent company is committed to its casino subsidiary and believes there is still plenty of opportunity for growth in the local market.</p>
<p>According to the company’s CEO, Marc Schorr, “We are very pleased with our second quarter results and remain focused on our strategic priorities: growing organically through disciplined capital allocation to our best-in-class assets and pursuing bolt-on acquisitions; driving value creation for shareholders through strong free cash flow generation; and continuing to enhance the guest experience.”</p>
<p>In addition to its commitment to Station Casinos, Red Rock Resorts also announced that it has entered into an agreement to sell the Grand Victoria Casino in Elgin, Illinois for $280 million. This sale is expected to close by the end of 2017.</p>
<p>Red Rock Resorts’ decision to focus on local markets and pursue bolt-on acquisitions makes sense when you consider the current state of the casino industry. With increasing competition from surrounding states, casino operators need to be more nimble and able to react quickly in order to stay competitive. Additionally, given that gaming revenues have been declining nationwide, casino companies are looking for ways to drive profitability and increase shareholder value.</p>
<h1 id="Station-Casino’s-Parent-Company-Hopes-to-Expand-Operations"><a href="#Station-Casino’s-Parent-Company-Hopes-to-Expand-Operations" class="headerlink" title="Station Casino’s Parent Company Hopes to Expand Operations"></a>Station Casino’s Parent Company Hopes to Expand Operations</h1><h1 id="-3"><a href="#-3" class="headerlink" title=""></a></h1><p>The parent company of Station Casino’s is looking to expand its operations. The goal is to have the company’s brands in 20 states within the next five years.</p>
<p>The company, Red Rock Resorts, is looking to grow its operations with $1.5 billion in capital expenditures. $500 million of that will be used to complete the development of the company’s new property in Las Vegas.</p>
<p>Red Rock Resorts owns and operates 17 properties across 10 states. The company plans to use the majority of its capital expenditures to grow its presence in three key markets; California, Illinois, and Nevada.</p>
<p>In Illinois, Red Rock Resorts will open a property in Elgin this year. The casino will have 220 tables and 2,000 slots. In California, the company will open a hotel-casino in Downtown Sacramento. And finally, in Nevada, Red Rock Resorts will continue the development of its property on the Las Vegas Strip.</p>
<p>The expansion into these new markets comes as the gaming industry has seen some slowness recently due to increased regulation and competition from other forms of entertainment such as Netflix and online gaming.</p>
<p>Despite this slowdown, Red Rock Resort’s CEO believes there is still plenty of opportunity for growth in the gaming industry. “Our industry has faced some challenges in recent years but we remain bullish on our prospects,” he said. “We are committed to investing in our business and look forward to continuing our track record of delivering outstanding returns for our shareholders.”</p>
