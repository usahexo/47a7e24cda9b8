#  Bayern Munich advance in Champions League after half a win over Porto

Bayern Munich are through to the Champions League quarter-finals after a David Alaba goal on the stroke of half-time was enough to win the first leg at home to Porto.

It was a disjointed performance from Bayern, with few clear chances created, but they will be content with the one-goal advantage as they travel to Portugal for the return leg.

Bavarian fans were given some early encouragement when Franck Rib√©ry hit the post in the opening minutes, but it was Porto who had the majority of the chances in an entertaining first half.

Iker Casillas was forced into a number of fine saves to keep his side in the game, while at the other end, Alphonso Davies and Joshua Kimmich both went close for Bayern.

The decisive goal came right on halftime when Alaba's shot took a wicked deflection off Felipe and looped over Casillas into the net.

Porto piled on the pressure in the second half but Bayern held on for a valuable win which sees them join Real Madrid, Barcelona, Juventus and Manchester City in the last eight of Europe's top club competition.

#  Robert Lewandowski's stoppage-time penalty earns Bayern Munich draw with Sevilla

Robert Lewandowski's stoppage-time penalty earned Bayern Munich a draw with Sevilla in the Champions League on Tuesday.

The Bundesliga champions had looked set to lose for the first time in this season's competition when Joaquin Correa put Sevilla ahead in the second half at the Ramon Sanchez Pizjuan.

But Bayern, who are already through to the last 16 as Group E winners, equalised through Lewandowski's 95th-minute spot-kick after he was brought down by goalkeeper David Soria.

"It's always important to score late on and get a point," said Lewandowski. "We're through to the next round, but we wanted to win here."

Sevilla had been hoping to snatch third place and an automatic berth in the Europa League knockout stages, but they now risk being pipped by Celtic, who beat bottom side Rosenborg 3-1.

"Football is like that," said Sevilla coach Vincenzo Montella. "We were unlucky today, but I'm happy with my players."

#  Bayern Munich defeated Hoffenheim with a clear 2-0 victory 

After the German Supercup debacle, Bayern Munich got their groove back with an emphatic 2-0 win against Hoffenheim. Goals from Corentin Tolisso and Joshua Kimmich gave Bayern all three points on the opening day of the Bundesliga season.

New head coach Niko Kovac had to make do without a number of injured players, but was still able to field a strong side. Hoffenheim started brightly, but it was Bayern who took the lead in the 21st minute. James Rodriguez played in Tolisso, who finished coolly past keeper Oliver Baumann.

The second half followed a similar pattern, with Hoffenheim having more chances but Bayern always looking dangerous on the break. The home side finally made it 2-0 in the 73rd minute, Kimmich firing home after good work from Serge Gnabry.

There was no way back for Hoffenheim and Bayern saw out the game to record a comfortable victory in the first competitive game under their new head coach.

#  Bundesliga: Late goals keep Bayern Munich perfect

Bayern Munich's perfect start to their Bundesliga title defence continued at the weekend with late goals from Arturo Vidal and Robert Lewandowski securing a 2-0 victory over Hamburg.

The champions have now won all six of their games this season, scoring 15 goals and conceding just twice.

Vidal's header from a Franck Ribery cross in the 87th minute made sure of the points, before Lewandowski grabbed his ninth goal of the campaign in stoppage time.

"We're very happy with the win and with our current form," said Bayern midfielder Sebastian Rudy. "But we're not getting carried away - there's a lot of football still to be played."

Elsewhere, Borussia Dortmund bounced back from their first defeat of the season last week by hammering Cologne 5-1, while RB Leipzig moved up to second with a 5-0 thumping of Freiburg.

Here is a roundup of all the action from Bundesliga Matchday 7:

BAYERN MUNICH 2-0 HAMBURG

Bayern Munich continued their 100% start to the Bundesliga season with a comfortable 2-0 victory over Hamburg on Saturday.

Arturo Vidal's header in the 87th minute was followed by Robert Lewandowski's strike in stoppage time as Carlo Ancelotti's side kept their six-match winning streak alive.

"We knew it would be difficult today as Hamburg are very good at defending," said Bayern midfielder Sebastian Rudy. "But we showed patience and got the goals in the end."

With 15 goals scored and just two conceded, Bayern are well on course for another successful league campaign. Next up for Ancelotti's men is a trip to face Mainz on September 16.

BORUSSIA DORTMUND 5-1 COLOGNE
DRESDEN 3-2 WERDER BREMEN 

RB LEIPZIG 5-0 FREIBURG

#  Bayern Munich stumble against Wolfsburg, but remain on top

Bayern Munich were held to a 1-1 draw by Wolfsburg on Saturday, but remain top of the Bundesliga.

Arturo Vidal opened the scoring for Bayern in the first half, but Wolfsburg equalised after the break through Maximilian Arnold.

The result means Bayern have now gone two league games without a win, following their 3-0 defeat to Paris Saint-Germain in the Champions League last week.

But they are still five points clear of second-placed RB Leipzig, and remain favourites to win the Bundesliga this season.
