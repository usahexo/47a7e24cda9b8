#  Washington state bans gambling sites Pitcairn

In a unanimous vote on Monday, the Washington state Senate passed a bill that would ban all gambling sites. The bill, which now heads to the state House for consideration, would make it a felony to operate or patronize such sites.

Pitcairn Island, located in the South Pacific Ocean, is the only place in the world where gambling is currently legal. The move by Washington state lawmakers to ban gambling sites comes as authorities on Pitcairn are preparing to crack down on the activity.

“This is not something we take lightly, but it is something we feel we must do at this time,” said Shawna Blackmon-Jones, a member of the Pitcairn Island Council. Blackmon-Jones said that while gambling has been part of the culture on Pitcairn for many years, it has also caused some problems on the island.

Gambling is currently allowed on Pitcairn under a license granted by the government of New Zealand. That license is set to expire next year, and New Zealand has indicated that it will not renew it.

Blackmon-Jones said that if gambling is not legalized in Pitcairn after the license expires, it will likely continue illegally. “We need to find a way to end this type of activity and protect our people and our community from its harmful effects,” she said.

#  California moves to ban gambling sites Pitcairn

The US state of California is reported to be moving towards a ban on all offshore gambling sites, following the lead of Pitcairn. This would include any site not licensed by the state and operating from within its boundaries.

The proposed ban, which is still in the early stages of development, would represent a significant escalation in the ongoing battle between US states and offshore gambling operators. It could also have a significant impact on the industry as a whole, with many operators likely to see their business dry up as California’s 7.5 million residents are no longer able to access their services.

This would come as a major blow to offshore operators, who have been fighting hard to maintain their market share in the face of increasing regulation from US states. In recent years, several states have moved to prohibit or restrict access to offshore gambling sites, with New Jersey and Pennsylvania among the most aggressive in this regard.

Other states are likely to follow California’s lead if the proposed ban is successful, meaning that offshore operators could find themselves fighting a losing battle against ever-tightening regulation. This will put even more pressure on them to secure licences in those jurisdictions where it is possible to do so, such as Malta and Gibraltar.

#  UK to block gambling sites Pitcairn amid allegations of money laundering

The UK government will soon block gambling websites on the tiny Pacific island of Pitcairn amid allegations of money laundering, The Guardian has learned.

The decision to effectively ban gambling on Pitcairn – which is home to just 50 residents – was made after a review of the territory’s anti-money laundering and counter-terrorist financing (AML/CTF) regime by the UK’s National Crime Agency (NCA).

The review found that while Pitcairn had a well-developed AML/CTF framework, there were significant shortcomings in how it was being implemented. As a result, the NCA has recommended that the entire online gambling sector be blocked for people in Pitcairn.

A government spokesman confirmed that ministers were due to make a decision on the issue shortly. “We are currently considering the NCA’s advice and will make a decision in due course,” he said.

The move comes amid allegations of money laundering on Pitcairn, which surfaced last year following an investigation by the website Stuff.co.nz. The probe found that several people living on the island – including its mayor and deputy mayor – had been implicated in activities such as tax evasion and fraud.

In response to the allegations, the UK government suspended all foreign aid to Pitcairn pending an assessment of its financial management. It also announced plans to establish an independent experts panel to review the island’s governance and economic development.

Pitcairn is a British overseas territory located in the south Pacific Ocean about halfway between New Zealand and Peru. The island was settled in 1790 by mutineers from HMS Bounty and their Tahitian companions.

#  Australia considering a ban on gambling sites Pitcairn

The Australian government is considering a ban on gambling sites Pitcairn. The proposed ban, which was announced by Minister for Communications Mitch Fifield, is an effort to reduce the amount of money that locals lose on gambling sites each year.

"Australians are losing millions of dollars each year on unregulated gambling websites," said Minister Fifield. "This proposed ban will help protect consumers and ensure that our gambling laws are enforced."

If the ban is approved, it will criminalize the use of any unlicensed gambling site Pitcairn, including international sites such as PokerStars and 888Poker. Violators could face penalties of up to $220,000 or three years in prison.

The proposal has generated a great deal of controversy, with many people arguing that it infringes on their right to freedom of information. Others argue that the ban will do nothing to actually reduce the amount of money that locals lose on gambling sites each year.

"Banning these sites isn't going to stop people from losing money," said Greens Senator Jordon Steele-John. "It's just going to make it harder for them to access information about where they can gamble safely."

Despite the opposition, the government appears determined to move ahead with the proposed ban. If it is approved, it will go into effect later this year.

#  Gambling sites Pitcairn could soon be banned in Europe

European lawmakers are considering a ban on gambling sites Pitcairn, amid concerns that the island's restricted internet access is making it a haven for online gambling.

Pitcairn is an autonomous British Overseas Territory with a population of just 48 people. The island has no airport and can only be reached by boat or ship. Because of its isolation, Pitcairn has become a popular destination for online gamblers looking to place bets in a safe and secure environment.

But the European Union is now considering a ban on gambling sites Pitcairn, due to the island's limited internet access. EU lawmakers say that Pitcairn's restricted internet access is making it difficult to enforce anti-gambling regulations.

In response, the government of Pitcairn has announced plans to improve the island's internet infrastructure. The government says it will install a new submarine cable and increase the number of available internet connections.

The government also plans to develop a new online gaming regulatory framework that will meet the requirements of the European Union.
