#  Precisely What Is The Ceiling For Sports Gambling Stocks?

A great deal of ink has been spilled on sports gambling in the past year, with much of it focused on whether or not the activity will soon be legalized nationwide. However, very little attention has been paid to what effect such a move would have on the stocks of companies that are currently in the business of gambling.

Given the potential size of the market, it is worth asking what the ceiling might be for these stocks. The answer to that question likely depends on a number of factors, including how tightly regulated gambling is post-legalization and how quickly new states come on board.

That being said, there are a few things we can say with some certainty. First, legalization is likely to be a boon for existing casino operators such as MGM Resorts International (MGM) and Caesars Entertainment Corporation (CZR). These companies are well positioned to capitalize on the growing demand for sports gambling, particularly in states that have already legalized it.

In addition, gaming technology providers such as Scientific Games Corporation (SGMS) and International Game Technology PLC (IGT) are also likely to benefit from the expansion of legalized gambling. These companies provide software and other services that help casinos manage their gaming operations.

Finally, it's worth noting that many online betting operators are likely to see a boost in business following legalization. Companies like Stars Group Inc. (TSG) and Penn National Gaming Inc. (PENN) are well positioned to capitalize on this trend thanks to their strong brands and extensive networks of online customers.

All told, there is certainly upside potential for investors who bet on companies with exposure to the legalized sports gambling market. While there are no guarantees, those who focus on well-positioned operators stand to make handsome profits if legalization expands as expected.

#  Sports Betting Gambling Revenue On The Rise

Sports betting is on the rise, and with it, gambling revenue. In the U.S., gambling revenue totaled $57.2 billion in 2017, a 2.9% increase from 2016. The majority of this revenue (51%) comes from casino gaming, but sports betting is gaining ground quickly.

In Nevada, for example, gambling revenue from sports betting totaled $527 million in 2017, accounting for 9% of the state’s total gambling revenue. This number is up from just $204 million in 2012, demonstrating the rapid growth of the industry. Delaware and New Jersey have also seen large increases in sports betting revenue since they legalized it in 2012.

So why is sports betting growing at such a fast pace? There are a few reasons:

First, there has been a shift in sentiment towards sports betting. In recent years, there has been a move away from traditional forms of gambling (like slots and blackjack) to more interactive games like poker and sports betting. This is partly due to the proliferation of online gambling sites which make it easy to bet on sports games.

Second, the legalization of sports betting in some states has made it more accessible to consumers. In particular, the repeal of the federal ban on sports betting (the Professional and Amateur Sports Protection Act) in 2018 has led to a surge in interest in the industry. This repeal allows states to legalize and regulate their own sports betting industries, providing consumers with more options when it comes to where they can bet.

Third, the increasing popularity of professional and college sports has led to more interest in sports betting. Americans love watching their favorite teams compete and they are also increasingly comfortable making bets on these games. In fact, a recent survey found that 43% of Americans would be interested in placing bets on NFL games if it was legal to do so. This suggests that there is significant potential for growth in the sports betting industry moving forward.

If you’re interested in getting into the action, here are a few tips:

1) Start small – It’s important to start out small when you’re first starting out with sports betting. This way you can learn about the different types of bets available and figure out which ones are best suited for you. Make sure to research all your options before placing any bets!

2) Use a reputable site – When choosing an online gambling site, be sure to use one that is reputable and has a good reputation among users. Check reviews online before signing up for an account.

3) Play responsibly – Gambling should always be done responsibly! Don’t spend more than you can afford to lose and make sure to set limits on how much you’re willing to bet each day/week/month).

#  How High Will Sports Gambling Stocks Go?

The Supreme Court’s decision to overturn the federal ban on sports gambling has sent shockwaves throughout the stock market. The gambling industry is expected to grow rapidly, and investors are scrambling to buy up shares in sports betting companies.

The top stocks in the space include DraftKings, FanDuel, and William Hill. All three stocks have seen their share prices surge in the past few days. It remains to be seen how high these stocks will go, but there is certainly a lot of money to be made in the gambling industry.

The repeal of the federal ban is a major victory for the gambling industry. For years, companies have been lobbying for change, and now they finally have it. Gambling is a multi-billion dollar industry, and there is plenty of room for growth.

The repeal of the federal ban will likely lead to an increase in sports betting nationwide. This could potentially be a boon for states that have recently legalized sports betting, such as Nevada and New Jersey.

Sports betting is already big business in Nevada, where casinos generate more than $2 billion per year from wagers. This number is expected to grow now that sports gambling is legal nationwide.

New Jersey stands to benefit as well. The state has already generated more than $16 million in revenue from sports betting since it was legalized in June. This number is expected to grow rapidly now that the federal ban has been overturned.

The gambling industry is poised for rapid growth in the coming years. Investors who want to capitalize on this trend should consider buying shares in one of the top stocks in the space. These include DraftKings, FanDuel, and William Hill.
