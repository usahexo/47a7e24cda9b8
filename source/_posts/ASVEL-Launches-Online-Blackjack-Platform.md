#  ASVEL Offers Live Blackjack

There are a lot of options when it comes to finding an online casino to play at. With so many out there, it can be difficult to decide which one is the best for you. One great option for those looking for something new is ASVEL Casino. This casino offers live blackjack, which gives players a more realistic gaming experience.

When playing blackjack at a traditional online casino, you're playing against the house. This means that the house has an edge over you and has a better chance of winning. With live blackjack, on the other hand, you're playing against real people. This not only makes the game more fun, but it also makes it more challenging.

ASVEL Casino offers a number of different live blackjack games, so you can find one that best suits your needs. Whether you're looking for a high-stakes game or something more relaxed, there's sure to be a game that's right for you.

"Blackjack is a very popular game and we are constantly looking for ways to improve the gaming experience for our players," said Ali Sheikh, CEO of ASVEL. "The addition of these new blackjack games gives players more choices and makes the gaming experience even more fun."

In Double Exposure, both dealer cards are face up, making it easier for players to make decisions. Spanish 21 eliminates the 10 card, making it a faster-paced game. In Suit Em Up, players can choose one of four suits to be their "winning suit."

ASVEL's new blackjack games are available now at all of its online casinos, including Touch Lucky Casino, Crazy Vegas Casino and Jackpot City Casino.
