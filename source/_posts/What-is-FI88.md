#  Why should you trust them?

If you're like most people, you probably don't trust just anyone. You likely have a small circle of people that you trust and rely on for guidance and support. The same should be true when it comes to your finances - you should only trust those who have your best interests at heart.

When it comes to finding someone to help manage your money, there's no better option than a fee-only financial planner. Here's why:

1. They're not influenced by commissions.

One of the main reasons to trust a fee-only planner is that they're not influenced by commissions. This means they won't recommend products or services solely because they earn a commission from them. Instead, they'll only recommend products that are best for you.

2. They have your best interests at heart.

 Fee-only planners are required to put your best interests first, which is something you can't always say about other types of planners. They're not motivated by commissions or sales goals, so they'll always recommend what's in your best interest - even if it's not what's in their best interest.

3. They're unbiased and objective.

Since fee-only planners don't sell products or services, they're unbiased and objective when it comes to providing advice. This means they'll give you honest advice, even if it's not what you want to hear. They won't try to push products on you or steer you in a certain direction - they'll simply provide you with the information you need to make the best decision for yourself.

#  How has their service been so far?

Since its inception, there have been mixed reviews about the quality of service provided by the new company. Some people swear by the incredible customer service they've received, while others complain about the long wait times and lack of response from customer service representatives.

# What are some of the pros?

Despite some of the negative aspects, there are several pros to using this company's services. For starters, their prices are unbeatable and they offer a wide variety of products and services. They're also very convenient; you can order anything from anywhere in the world and have it delivered right to your doorstep.

# What are some of the cons?

Even though there are several pros to using this company, there are also several cons. First and foremost, their customer service is notoriously bad; many customers have complained about long wait times and unhelpful customer service representatives. Additionally, their shipping times are often slow and their products are not always high quality.
