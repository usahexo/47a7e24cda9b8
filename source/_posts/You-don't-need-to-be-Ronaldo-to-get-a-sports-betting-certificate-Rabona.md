#  You don't need to be Ronaldo to get a sports betting certificate Rabona

Most people think that in order to get a sports betting certificate, you have to be Ronaldo or Messi. But that's not the case. In fact, there are plenty of other players who are just as good – and sometimes even better – than those two, yet don't get the same level of attention.

Take Gareth Bale for example. He's one of the best players in the world and is often overshadowed by Ronaldo and Messi. Or take Luis Suarez, who is widely considered to be one of the best strikers in the game today. He's been scoring goals for fun at Barcelona and is a major part of their attack.

There are plenty of other players who could be mentioned here, but the point is that you don't have to be Ronaldo or Messi to get a sports betting certificate. There are plenty of other great players out there who can help you make some money on the side.
