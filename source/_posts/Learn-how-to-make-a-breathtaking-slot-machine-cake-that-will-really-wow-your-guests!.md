#  Learn how to make a breathtaking slot machine cake that will really wow your guests!

Making a slot machine cake may seem daunting, but with this tutorial you can easily make one that will wow your guests!

To start off, you'll need to bake two 9 inch cake rounds. You can use any flavor cake recipe you like, but we recommend a chocolate cake for this particular cake. Once the cakes have cooled, you'll need to frost them using your favorite frosting recipe. We recommend using a chocolate frosting for this cake.

Next, you'll need to make the "slot machine" details. To do this, you'll need some candy melts in either silver or gold colors. You'll also need a Wilton candy mold in the shape of a slot machine. If you don't have one, you can find one online or at a craft store.

Melt the candy melts according to the instructions on the package. Once they are melted, pour them into the candy mold and swirl them around until they are evenly coated. Then, place the candy mold in the fridge for about 30 minutes so that the candy melts harden.

Once they are hardened, remove them from the fridge and pop them out of the mold. Then, using a toothpick or other sharp object, poke small holes into each of the "slots". These will be where you insert the candles later on.

Now it's time to assemble the cake! Start by placing one of the cake rounds on a serving plate or cake stand. Then, spread about 1/2 cup of frosting over top of the cake round. Next, place half of the candy melts onto the top of the frosting and spread them around until they are evenly coated.

Next, place the second cake round on top of the first round and press down slightly so that they stick together. Then, frost overtop of the entire cake with remaining frosting and smooth it out. Finally, add remaining candy melts to top of cake and press down slightly so that they stick to frosting.

Your slot machine cake is now complete! Insert birthday candles into each of the "slots" and enjoy!
