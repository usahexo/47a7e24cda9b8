#  State considering legalizing gambling in Texas

The state of Texas is considering legalizing gambling in order to generate more revenue for the state. There are many different types of gambling that could be legalized, including casinos, lottery, and sports betting.

There are many opponents to gambling legalization, who argue that it will lead to more addiction and social problems. However, proponents argue that gambling can be a valuable source of revenue for the state, and that it can be regulated to minimize its negative effects.

Texas has not yet decided whether or not to legalize gambling, but the issue is sure to continue to be debated in the coming months and years.

#  Texas lawmakers discuss gambling legalization

Gambling has been a topic of discussion at the Texas Capitol for years. But lawmakers are getting closer to a resolution.

The Senate passed a bill Tuesday that would legalize gambling in the state. The measure now goes to the House, where it is also expected to pass.

“This is a very important issue to the citizens of Texas, and I think we have a good chance to get it done this session,” said Sen. Juan “Chuy” Hinojosa, D-McAllen, one of the authors of the bill.

Backers of gambling legalization say it could generate up to $1 billion in new revenue for the state each year. Some of that money would go toward education and mental health services.

Opponents argue that gambling can lead to addiction and other social problems. They also say it would cannibalize revenue from existing casinos and racetracks.

Texas is one of only a few states that doesn’t allow any form of gambling. Louisiana, Oklahoma and New Mexico all have tribal casinos. Mississippi has both tribal and commercial casinos. Arkansas has two racetracks with electronic games of chance.

At least three dozen states allow some form of casino gambling, including slots, blackjack and poker. Some allow riverboat or cruise ship gambling, while others have dedicated casinos like those in Las Vegas or Atlantic City.

A study by the Spectrum Gaming Group estimated that Texans spend about $2.5 billion annually on illegal gambling activities such as betting on sports or playing poker in home games. That compares with about $24 billion spent on legal casino gambling in other states.

The legalization of gambling in Texas has been debated off and on for decades but never approved by the Legislature. Advocates say new technology has made online gaming more palatable to lawmakers and voters, while opponents contend that expanded legalized gaming could create more social problems

#  Lawmakers mull bill to legalize gambling in Texas

Texas lawmakers are considering a bill that would legalize gambling in the state.

The bill, filed by Representative Geanie Morrison, would allow casinos, race tracks, and other gambling venues to operate in Texas. Gambling would be limited to those age 21 and older.

Morrison says the bill is about bringing more money into the state. "This bill is about economic development and job creation," she said. "It will provide much-needed revenue for our schools, roads, and public safety."

Opponents of legalizing gambling argue that it can lead to addiction and social ills. They also say that it will cannibalize the state's existing gaming industries, such as the lottery.

If the bill passes, Texas would become the latest state to legalize gambling. Currently, there are only two states – Hawaii and Utah – where gambling is illegal.

#  Gambling could be legalized in Texas by the end of the year

There is a good chance that gambling could be legalized in Texas by the end of the year. Lawmakers are currently considering a bill that would allow for casino gambling in the state. If the bill is passed, it could mean big things for the Texas economy.

Opponents of gambling argue that it can lead to addiction and other social problems. However, supporters say that it can be regulated effectively and can bring in much-needed revenue to the state.

Casino gambling is currently legal in 40 states, and it has been shown to be a lucrative industry. In Pennsylvania, for example, casino gambling brings in more than $1 billion in revenue each year.

If Texas decides to legalize casino gambling, it could become a major tourist destination. Thousands of people from all over the country would flock to casinos in Dallas, Houston, and other cities in the state. This would create jobs and boost the economy.

It’s important to note that the bill still has a long way to go before it becomes law. There is significant opposition to casino gambling, and it’s unclear whether lawmakers will be able to pass it. However, there is a real chance that Texas will join the majority of states who have already legalized casino gambling.

#  Texas closer to legalizing gambling after state Senate vote

Texas could be one step closer to legalizing gambling after the state Senate approved a measure that would allow voters to decide whether to legalize casino gambling.

The proposal, SB 993, was passed by a vote of 21-10 and will now head to the state House for consideration. The measure would allow up to 10 casinos to be built in Texas, with slot machines and table games being offered at each location.

Gambling is currently illegal in Texas, with the exception of charitable bingo and raffles.

 Supporters of the bill argue that legalizing gambling would help generate much-needed revenue for the state. Opponents, however, argue that gambling can be addictive and lead to financial ruin.

If the measure is approved by the House and signed into law by Governor Greg Abbott, it would be put before voters in a referendum in November 2019.
